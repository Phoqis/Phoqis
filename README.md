- 👋 Hi, I’m @Phoqis
- 👀 I’m interested in web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the very bare bones basics of code. It's both challenging and fun!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on basically anything that will help me apply what I learn in new ways.
- 📫 How to reach me: My discord name is 'Focus #0905'.
-  PS: I am Focus just for all the puns and jokes I can make. Take that as your warning.
